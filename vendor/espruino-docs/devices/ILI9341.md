![ILI9341 LCD module](module.jpg)

This is an extremely common LCD controller for 320x240 LCDs. These are available cheaply from via various suppliers online.

Support is included in the [[ILI9341.js]] module, using the [[Graphics]] library.

Just wire up as follows:

| LCD pin | Pin type | Example pin on Espruino Board |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------|
|  VCC       | 5V       | Bat                        |
|  GND       | GND      | GND                        |
|  CS        | Any      | B8                         |
|  RESET     | Any      | B7                         |
|  D/C       | Any      | B6                         |
|  SDI(MOSI) | SPI MOSI | B5                         |
|  SCK       | SPI SCK  | B3                         |
|  LED       | Any      | B2                         |
|  SDO(MISO) | SPI MISO | B4 (Unused)                |

```
B2.set(); // light on
SPI1.setup({sck:B3, miso:B4, mosi:B5, baud: 1000000});
var g = require("ILI9341").connect(SPI1, B6, B8, B7, function() {
  g.clear();
  g.drawString("Hello",0,0);
  g.setFontVector(20);
  g.setColor(0,0.5,1);
  g.drawString("Espruino",0,10);
});
```

Note:

* The display takes around 200ms to initialise after calling 'connect'. There's an optional callback that is called after this time (shown in the example). Sending data to it before initialisation may cause it not to initialise correctly.
* This module doesn't use a double-buffer as there isn't enough RAM. Pixels are written to the display as they are drawn, and the driver is written in JavaScript so it is relatively slow.
