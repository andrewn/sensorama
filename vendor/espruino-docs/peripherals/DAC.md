Digital to Analog Converter
=======================

* KEYWORDS: Analog,DAC,D2A,Built-In

**Note:** Very few pins (usually only 2) are capable of Analog Output, and some boards don't have any. See the [[Reference]] for your board and look for ```DAC```.

Analog outputs are easy to write in Espruino:

```analogWrite(A4, 0.5)```

This writes an analog value to A4, which should be **0.5*3.3v = 1.65v**

Note that if you use ```analogWrite``` on a pin that is not capable of analog outputs but that can handle [[PWM]], Espruino will automatically use [[PWM]] to create an analog value on that pin instead.
