/* 
LED Volume (VU) Meter
==================

* KEYWORDS: VU Meter,Volume Meter,Light Show,Audio
* USES: WS2811,Waveform

This creates a simple sound-reactive LED meter on a string of WS2811 Lights. Varying numbers of LEDs light up white in response to the volume of sound detected.

[[WS2811]] Wiring:

| WS2811  | Pin on Espruino Board         |
|---------|-------------------------------|
|  GND    | GND                           |
|  DIN    | B15                           |
|  VCC    | Bat                           |

Audio Wiring:

| Audio       | Pin on Espruino Board     |
|-------------|---------------------------|
|  GND        | GND (via 4.7k resistor)   |
|  GND        | 3.3v (via 4.7k resistor)  |
|  Sound      | A0                        |

The resistors are required because Audio Signals are typically between -1v and +1v, and Espruino will only take in voltages between 0 and 3.3v.

**DO NOT** connect this to the Audio output of your laptop while Espruino is plugged in (as USB ground is typically the same as audio ground). Instead, use a portable MP3 player or phone that is not plugged into a charger.
