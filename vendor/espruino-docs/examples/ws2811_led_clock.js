/*
LED Clock (using WS8111)
========================

* KEYWORDS: Clock,Watch,Time
* USES: WS2811,Clock

This creates a simple clock using strings of WS2811 LEDs.

The idea is to have a string of 24 LEDs, arranged in two rings of 12.

Then, one LED is lit up for hours, minutes, seconds, and there's even a fast-moving one for sub-seconds.

[[WS2811]] Wiring:

| WS2811  | Pin on Espruino Board         |
|---------|-------------------------------|
|  GND    | GND                           |
|  DIN    | B15                           |
|  VCC    | Bat                           |

Note that Espruino doesn't normally keep great time (It could drift off by as much as a second a minute).
To keep better time, check out the [page on how to add a Watch Crystal](http://www.espruino.com/Clocks).

To change the time, plug into a PC and issue the commands:

```
time.hours = 12;
time.mins = 54;
time.secs = 0;
```

// setup SPI comms for the LED strip
SPI2.setup({baud:3200000, mosi:B15});
// store current time...
var time = { 
  hours : 10,
  mins : 36,
  secs : 0
};


/** Add red,green and blue light for light number 'n' 
 and the light next to it. 
 
 lights : array of light data
 offset : where in the lights array do we start from? 
       0 = first string, 12*3 = second string
 r,g,b  : red green and blue between 0 and 255       
 n      : light number. Rolls over after 11 and can be fractional,
          so:
 
 so for instance:
  n = 1     - set just light 1
  n = 1.1   - set light 1 to 90% and 2 to 10%
  n = 1.5   - set light 1 to 50% and 2 to 50%
  n = 1.9   - set light 1 to 10% and 2 to 90%
  n = 15.5   - set light 3 to 50% and 4 to 50%
*/

  var led = Math.floor(n);
  // work out the percentage of light on the second light (see above)
  var amt = n - led;
  var namt = 1-amt; // percentage of light on the first light
  // work out which light
  var n1 = offset+(led%12)*3;
  var n2 = offset+((led+1)%12)*3;
