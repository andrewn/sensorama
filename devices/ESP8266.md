![ESP8266 module](module.jpg)

Support is provided in Espruino, but **you will have to use a special build of Espruino designed for it** as there isn't enough space in flash to hold both CC3000 and ESP8266 drivers.

To get the latest ESP8266 binary:

* Go to http://www.espruino.com/binaries and look for a file titled `espruino_XXX_espruino_1r3_esp8266.bin`, where `XXX` is the latest version
* Right-click on it, and click `Copy Link Address`
* Open the Web IDE, and click on Settings in the top-right
* Click on `Flasher`
* Paste the link into the `Advanced Firmware Update` text box
* Click the `Advanced Firmware Update` button and follow the instructions.

You can also [get a recent Espruino Git build](http://www.espruino.com/binaries/git) or can build it yourself.

To build yourself, follow [the instructions here](http://www.github.com/espruino/Espruino) and build with `ESP8266=1 RELEASE=1 ESPRUINO_1V3=1 make`.

Wiring Up
--------

![ESP8266 pinout](pinout.png)

(viewed from component side)

| Pin  | Espruino | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| URXD | C10      | Serial3 / Serial4      |
| VCC  | 3.3      | You'll need an extra 3.3v regulator for this.<br/>The Espruino board can't supply enough power. |
| GPIO0  | Not Connected    |       |
| RST    | Not Connected    |       |
| GPIO2  | Not Connected    |       |
| CH_PD  | 3.3    | Boot mode - must be 1 to enable WiFi      |
| GND  | GND      |       |
| UTXD | C11      | Serial3 / Serial4      |

The board communicates at 115200 8 baud, 1 stop bit, no parity.

To add a voltage regulator, we'd suggest you wire up an LD1117AV33 as follows:

![LD1117AV33  connections](vreg.png)


Software
-------

```
Serial4.setup(115200, { rx: C11, tx : C10 });
console.log("Connecting to ESP8266");
var wifi = require("ESP8266").connect(Serial4, function() {
  console.log("Connecting to WiFi");
  wifi.connect("WiFi_Name","WPA2_Key", function() {
    console.log("Connected");
    require("http").get("http://192.168.1.50", function(res) {
      console.log("Response: ",res);
      res.on('data', function(d) {
        console.log("--->"+d);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

Apart from the initialisation (`require("ESP8266").connect(...)`) the networking code should be identical to that described on the [[Internet]] page.

Gotchas
------

* You can only have a maximum of 5 concurrent TCP/IP clients
* You can only have one TCP/IP server, and while it is active you *can not have any clients*
* You'll need to have an up to date firmware on the ESP8266 (v0.924 or later). See some of the links below for details.
