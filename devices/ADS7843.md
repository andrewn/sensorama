[Datasheet](/datasheets/ADS7843.pdf)

This is a common touchscreen controller used in a lot of boards, including the 'HY' boards that can run Espruino. It is handled by the [[ADS7843.js]] module.

**Note:** If you're using this on a board with a built-in LCD, you should probably use the [[Touchscreen]] module, as this has built-in support. 

In the module, 'connect' takes arguments for SPI, Chip Select, IRQ, and then offsets for x and y as well as multipliers.

The final argument is the callback function, which has two arguments (X and Y). When you move your finger on the touchscreen the X and Y coordinates are reported back, and when you lift your finger, the callback function is called once with X and Y set to undefined.

```
SPI1.setup({sck:A5,miso:A6,mosi:A7});
require("ADS7843").connect(SPI1, A4, B6, 0, 0, 320, 240, function(x,y) {
  if (x!==undefined)
    LCD.fillRect(x-1,y-1,x+1,y+1);
});
```
