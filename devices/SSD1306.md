![Crius C0-16 OLED Display](module.jpg)

This is the monochome OLED display driver found in the Crius C0-16 display (128x64).

It draws around 2.5mA (although this will increase if more pixels are lit).

Support is included in the [[SSD1306.js]] module, using the [[Graphics]] library.

Just wire up as follows:

| OLED pin | Pin type | Example pin on Espruino Board |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------|
|  1 (black)   | GND      | GND |
|  2 (red) | 5V    | 3.3/vBat |
|  3 (yellow) | SDA     | B7 |
|  4 (green) | SCL  | B6 |

**Note:** If you get I2C timeouts, you may need to add two 4.7 kOhm resistors, one from SDA to 3.3v, and one from SCL to 3.3v.


```
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7});
var g = require("SSD1306").connect(I2C1, function(){
   // write some text
   g.drawString("Hello World!",2,2);
   // write to the screen
   g.flip(); 
 }
);
```

Note:

* This module uses a double buffer, which means you need to call ```g.flip()``` before any changes take effect.
